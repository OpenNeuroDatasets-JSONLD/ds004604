# Cerebrovascular Reactivity Normative Dataset

Fifty healthy adult subjects with no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disorder were included in this dataset.

- Anatomical data: a standard T1w image was acquired for each subject.
- Functional data: each subject underwent an fMRI scan with blocs of CO2 inhalation challenges.
- Physiological data: breath CO2 was recorded using a capnograph during the fMRI acquisition.

The goal is to provide a normative dataset for the computation of maps of Cerebrovascular Reactivity Maps. For this purpose, we developed CVRmap, a BIDS-compatible pipeline to process the data. More information on CVRmap can be found on the github page
